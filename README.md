# Project-3-

To begin with, I started by creating my DigitalOcean account and setting up my droplet. After adjusting all my settings, I opened Windows PowerShell and connected to my droplet using its public IP address. Once I was logged in, I installed Docker and created my WireGuard Docker configuration, which I copied into a Notepad file. I then installed the WireGuard application on my computer and imported the configuration file to create my tunnel. After activating the tunnel, I checked my IP address and confirmed that it successfully changed to a new address located in San Francisco.
